# Mini Password Generator Manager


### Project Inspiration/Idea

As someone who suffer from both short and long memory issues this is  a project that is really special to me, they are some days when i don't even remember my own card pin
or a password i just created a new minutes ago, unfortunately this is a long story to keep it short, i have always wanted my own private password manager, with a built in password generator, because sometime one of the hardest thing you face when creating a new account on an online platform is deciding what password you want to use. I'm not trying to build a a suffiticated application nor do i know how to yet, but using everything i've learned on from the WildCodeSchool BootCamp i'm attempting this to test skills so far. this project is open for improvement and i welcome any idea to me it better in the future.

### The Project

This will be a minimal application designed with common known technologies like 
1. Reactjs
2. Express
3. Tailwind
4. Vite
5. TypeScritp
6. MySql
